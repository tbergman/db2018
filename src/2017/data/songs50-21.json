       "description": "Ryan Adams's recent full-blown embrace of 1980s anthem rock has led to some pretty excellent music in the last few years, starting with 2014's self-titled album and continuing with his <a target='_blank' href='https://dbradmusic.com/2015/09/25/poptimism-won-2015-who-won-1989/'>front-to-back cover of Taylor Swift's <i>1989</i></a>. 'Do You Still Love Me?' is another mid-tempo, heartland rocker that starts and stops with bursts of guitar and floating organ lines, building to a very satisfying chorus. It's like Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Foreigner all wrapped into a delicious package. I would have loved this as a classic-rock-obsessed high-schooler. The song does not qualify as original or challenging in any sense of those words, but sometimes you just need to relax with some comfort food.",

It doesn't matter if Kendrick is rapping fast or slow, over a fiery or chill beat -- he has something to say, and you're going to hear it. 'XXX.' combines the fast and slow, fiery and chill, to make a pointed statement about America.</p><p>'XXX.' puts Kendrick's inner conflict and dual personalities on display. It starts slow, with a chorus singing 'America, God Bless you if it's good to you. America, please take my hand. Can you help me understand?' After a few verses, Kendrick dials up the fury, and over a police siren-laden beat, raps about his loyalty to those closest to him, promising violence against anyone that violates them. 'Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward.' But then, the beat lets up as he says 'Alright kids, let's talk about gun control.' A moment of clear-headedness causes Kendrick to think twice about violence.</p><p>And then comes U2. Before releasing <i>DAMN.</i>, Kendrick posted a photo of the cover art, and there it was in the tracklist, dropped like a bomb: 'XXX. ft. U2.' U2? <b>Oh no, Kendrick's jumped the shark.</b> It's not a question of '<i>will</i> the rap song with Bono be cheesy?' but '<i>how</i> cheesy will the rap song with Bono be?' But the U2 feature is so well done, understated and tasteful. Over a soulful beat, Bono sings about the idea of America not as a place, but as a sound: 'It's not a place / This country is to me a sound of drum and bass / You close your eyes and look around.'</p><p>I would say the U2 feature is perfect, but Kendrick follows it up with an even more perfect verse, continuing the introspective personality he switched to on the gun control lyric: 'Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph / The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives.' 'It's murder on my street, your street, back streets / Wall Street, corporate offices / Banks, employees, and bosses with / homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office / We lost Barack and promised never to doubt him again'' And then the kicker: '<b>But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?</b> Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood.' Kendrick ends it with quite possibly the most thought-provoking lyric on the whole album: 'You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us / Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera / <b>America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does</b>.'</p>",

But if that's the price we must pay for his undeniable talent, then it's worth it. Tillman's latest album, <i>Pure Comedy</i>, goes heavy on mid-tempo ballads and low on variety, but every song is executed so beautifully, complete with his expectedly clever lyrics and his amazing voice. Seriously though, that voice. I'll venture to say that it's the most beautiful voice currently in indie, and certainly one of the top 10 voices in all of music right now.</p><p>'Ballad of the Dying Man' sounds a lot like an Elton John song, except with a heavy dose of sarcastic wit. It tells the tale of a man who spends his life self-importantly critiquing the world, but laments the fact that his imminent death means he'll no longer get to grace us with his opinions. The dying man sings 'Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok / And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked.' The last verse is particularly thought-provoking, as the man realizes he's maybe not as all-knowing as he thought: 'Eventually the dying man takes his final breath / But first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss / And it occurs to him a little late in the game / We leave as clueless as we came.'</p><p>It's all pretty hilarious and hits the nail on the head when it comes to describing our collective obsession with sharing everything we think on social media, regardless of whether anyone else cares or not. The music itself is beautiful, ending with a particularly gorgeous chorus of 'ohhs' and 'ahh's from a gospel choir. Tillman can be a tad insufferable, but man if he isn't smart and incredibly skilled at making music.</p>",

Arcade Fire, one of the most beloved and critically-acclaimed indie bands of the 21st century, released an empty whimper of an album in 2017, also called <i>Everything Now</i>. Half of the record's songs are half-baked, and almost all of them heavy-handed. Okay, technology and consumerism is bad, we get it. When the title track originally came out, I was not a fan. What's with the repetitive, basic chorus? 'Everything now! (I need it), everything now! (I want it)'? What's with the disco vibes? And is... is that a pan flute in there? It was very jarring, and it didn't help that the album as a whole was a disappointment. But <i>man</i>, 'Everything Now' is just so well constructed and executed. Every time I heard the song, I liked it better than the last time, bouncing my head to the strings, pan flute, and ABBA-like piano. Despite its context, 'Everything Now,' is extremely catchy.",

       "description": "The xx's third album, <i>I See You</i>, has proven to be a sure-footed leap forward for the British trio. I was a fan of the group's extra-minimalist approach on their first two albums (see <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pib8eYDSFEI'>'Crystalised'</a> for instance), but I love the expansion of their sound. 'Say Something Loving' is captivating ' the chemistry between singers Oliver Sim and Romy Madley Croft is as palpable as ever as they sing about fleeting feelings of love battling with their hesitations and insecurities, and Jamie xx's production pushes his bandmates to new heights.",

Future's personality shines through, but it's the singular beat that makes 'Mask Off.' It's light and airy, unique in a medieval kind of way, and immediately pleasing to the ear. Just putting this out there: I need to hear a mash-up of this with a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7jLiXeFm_E'>Jethro Tull song</a>. Somebody get on that, please.",

       "description": "<p>In March, Drake released what he calls a 'playlist project' entitled <i>More Life</i>, which is pretty much the same thing as an album but without the lofty expectations that accompany albums. It's basically a cop out, a shield against criticism. If it isn't received well, it doesn't matter because it's not <i>technically</i> an album. This characterization is working, because reviewers called <i>More Life</i> the best project Drake has done in years. That's an exaggeration - the 'playlist' certainly boasts some great highlights, but they're surrounded by a glut of mid-tempo filler.</p><p>'Passionfruit' is the highest of those highlights. It will never cease to amaze me how Drake, when he's on his game, can be so good at rap and also so good at pop/R&B. He's the <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Jackson'>Bo Jackson</a> of music, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dont+%40+me'>don't @ me</a>. 'Passionfruit' has Drake bringing his R&B A-game on a song that is aptly titled - imagine what a tropical Starburst would sound like. Got it? Yep, that's 'Passionfruit.' It's like <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillwave'>chillwave</a> with a vaguely Caribbean bent to it. Long live chillwave Drake.</p>",

It almost sounds like a faster, harder Dusty Springfield song, with an undoubtable late '60s flavor. Oh and also, Segarra's voice is very cool.",

The groove stays constant throughout, acting as an anchor for the epic increases and decreases in dynamics.",

The details he puts in his satisfying brew of rock and roll are delightful. About five minutes into 'Thinking of a Place,' the bass and drums drop out and you expect the song to close out, but then they come booming back in, and it's actually a huge relief. It is <i>astonishingly</i> rare for me to want a song to continue six minutes in, but I would feel cheated if 'Thinking of a Place' ended there. I've written many times about songs that hit the spot during an evening or night drive, but I think we've found the #1 contender for 'best night drive' song. Oh, and spoiler alert: this will not be the last time you see the War on Drugs on this list.",
